# NextJs 13 ChatApp

A Personal Project showcasing my skills in NextJS, Firebase Authentication and Real-time Database and Material User Interface Library(MUI).
## Installation

To run the application, make sure you have [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) installed in your computer so you can use npm cli. After downloading the project, go to it's directory and run

```bash
npm install
```
then you can now run the application in development using this command.
```bash
npm run dev
```


## Progress

This progress section will be deleted in the future.

Day 1:
- create the project and install MUI library.
- create login and register page with incomplete layout. no functionality yet but can navigate by changing the url or clicking button using Link.
- create message page with incomplete layout. I was thinking this will be the main for the whole message functions.
Day 2:
- create a github repo to store this project.
